# Rogue-Algorithms
Various algorithms controlling a player in a 2D Roguelike. Based off the 2D Roguelike tutorial from [Unity](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial).

# Algorithm Implementations
## A* Search Algorithm
Currently the only algorithm implemented is an A* algorithm which avoids enemies and walls, and attempts to get to the exit.
This however avoids almost all food pickups (unless it is in its path of travel)

Areas for improvement
* Work in food incentive
